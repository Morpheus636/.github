#### Why do I require a copyright assignment?
I require a copyright assignment for changes to my projects for the same reason as the Free Software Foundation, and they do a much better job of explaining it in [their post](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.en.html) than I could ever do.

Please email any questions about the copyright assignment to COPYRIGHT@morpheus636.com
